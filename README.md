# 🪁 Pragmasoft Test Task for QA Engineers

## Objective

This test task is created to assess the level of candidates applying for the QA Engineer vacancy at Pragmasoft.

It is designed to contain several challenges resembling the real-life daily work of a QA engineer.

Time is not constrained; you can take as much time as you need to provide the best quality result. Results are assessed in the order of their submission, and we usually only have one open position, so the faster you submit, the higher your chances of being hired. We will try to assess and review all sufficiently completed results, but cannot 100% guarantee this.

The result should be provided as a link to the public GitHub (or other git) repository in your public git profile. If you still don't have one, create one - it's free.

Please use English language everywhere.

## Testing Target

![OWASP Juice Shop](slideshow.gif "OWASP Juice Shop")

The [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) application will be used as a testing target.

You need to follow the instructions [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop) to run it locally using Docker.

## Testing challenges

👉🏻 Write a checklist to test the [Login form](http://localhost:3000/#/login). You can use Markdown, Wiki in your github repository, or any other convenient format as soon as it can be added to the repository (Text based formats are preferred).

👉🏻 Write a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection with a test, demonstrating that Customer Feedback can be added bypassing the CAPTCHA verification. Export the Postman collection to json and add it to the git repository.

👉🏻 Report issues you found in the Juice Shop application to the Issues section of your github repository. Don't report many issues, just few of the most critical ones you found. Concentrate on the quality instead.

Good luck with the test task, hope you enjoy it.

Any feedback about the test task itself, i.e. if something was unclear or can be improved is greatly appreciated.
